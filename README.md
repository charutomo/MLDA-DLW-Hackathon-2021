# MLDA-DLW-Hackathon-2021

**Welcome!** :wave:
<br/>

## Introduction
[Kieran](https://github.com/KieranNg), [Jun Guang](https://github.com/running-sand-box) and I are Year 2 Mathematical Science students from NTU under SPMS. 
Due to depression, people tend to not clean their rooms, by having a machine learning program, we can early detect and alert changes to room which help as early depression detection which we wish to target and help in.
 We are working on `Declutter`, an app/application to analysis a before-and-after photo of a room gauging cleaniness and give a rating using machine learning with Python and Tensorflow.
