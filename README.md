**Welcome!** :wave:

## Introduction
[Kieran](https://github.com/KieranNg), [Jun Guang](https://github.com/running-sand-box) and I are Team Rocket under Team Group 22.
We are Year 2 Mathematical Science students from NTU under SPMS. 
<br/>

## Problem Statement
We believe that AI has endless possibilities and it should not be limited to a certain theme. Therefore, your task is to build an AI-based solution that you are passionate about. The solution should be meaningful, have a positive impact on society or assist industries in their respective domain (software and hardware). 
Submissions will be judged based on creativity, impact (how useful is the solution), technical soundness (efficiency, performance).

## Our Solution
Due to depression, people tend to not clean their rooms, by having a machine learning program, we can early detect and alert changes to room which help as early depression detection which we wish to target and help in.
 We are working on `Declutter`, an app/application to analysis a before-and-after photo of a room gauging cleaniness and give a rating using machine learning with Python and Tensorflow.
